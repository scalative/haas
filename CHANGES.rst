Release 0.2.0
=============

Enhancements
------------

* ``haas`` now supports discovering tests by a substring of the test
  name, such as ``haas module_name.ClassName`` or ``haas
  ClassName.test_method`` or simply ``haas test_method``.
* ``haas`` uses a simple extension to the ``unittest.TextTestRunner``
  that shows the progress of the test run and a timestamp of when each
  test was started.  This is useful for projects with a very large
  number of tests that take more than a few minutes to run.


Release 0.1.0
=============

The initial release of ``haas``.

Features
--------

* ``haas`` is fully compatible with tests written using
  ``unittest.TestCase``.
* ``haas`` has a test discovery and loading mechanism to allow more
  advanced test discovery.  Most notably in this release is the unified
  interface for running a single test and discovering multiple tests.
* ``haas`` is able to infer the top level directory from within a
  project, resulting in the tests running in the correct environment and
  correctly supporting test modules that make use of relative imports.
